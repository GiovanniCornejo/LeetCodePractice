# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This branch contains solutions to various LeetCode problems in Rust. You can run any problem with the following command:

```bash
cargo test <problem_name>

Each test is called in snake_case. For example, the following will run the solution for the `Two Sum` problem
